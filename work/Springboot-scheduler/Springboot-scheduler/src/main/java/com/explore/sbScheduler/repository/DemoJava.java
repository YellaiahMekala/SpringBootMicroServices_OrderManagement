    /*Question: Employee Database Management You are tasked with creating an employee database management system using Java.

    Implement a class EmployeeDatabase that allows the user to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the employee records.

    Each employee record should contain the following information:
    Employee ID (integer) Employee Name (string) Employee Age (integer)

    The EmployeeDatabase class should have the following functionalities:
    Add a new employee to the database.
    Display all employees in the database.
    Update the details of an existing employee.
    Delete an employee from the database.

    Exit the program.

    Write the necessary Java code to implement the EmployeeDatabase class along with a sample usage of the class demonstrating the above functionalities.

    Note: You can use any data structure (such as an array, ArrayList, HashMap, etc.) to store the employee records.

    Your task is to write the implementation of the EmployeeDatabase class and demonstrate its usage through a sample program.

    Remember to handle edge cases, validate user input, and provide appropriate error messages.
